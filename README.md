# search-course
The Objective of this repository is to practice building a retriever with the datasets available as a part of the Search for RAG course

# Implementation plan
1. Decide evaluation metrics
    1. Check if all the relevant contexts have been retrieved (Recall)
    2. Check if all the retrieved contexts are relevant (Precision)
    3. Check if the ground truth answer is correct
    4. Check if the exact_answer is correct
2. Setup a baseline
3. Plan the RAG architecture
4. Develop iteratively
5. Use Latentscope to visualize the dataset
